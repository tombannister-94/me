00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.320
I'm Alex Tinkler

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.400
and today on Hero Strive,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.120
powered by Help for Heroes.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.840
We're going to be doing

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.920
a cardio based fitness session.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.680
You won't need any equipment for this.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.000
Just plenty of room to move about.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.480
Okay, let's get started

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.280
and let's strive together.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.480
Okay, everybody start with the warm up.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.400
So all I want you to do

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.120
is start is just a nice light

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.200
march on the spot.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.920
We're just going to do this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.880
for about 30 seconds, alright?

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.280
So as you start and just nice

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.280
light on the feet,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.200
just start to loosen through the arms,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.640
We're just going

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.040
to gradually start to build

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.120
that heart rate up

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920
nice and steady.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.640
Going to do this for 15 more seconds.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.560
Starting to lift those knees

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.760
that little bit higher

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.040
now. Next move,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.360
we're going to take it into a very light jog.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.120
Here we go nice and light on the feet,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.920
slightly, kicking the legs up.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.360
Now, if you don't want a jog,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.440
if this is going to be too much for you today,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.720
I just want you to stick with that march.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.640
But lift those knees

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.400
just a little bit higher and start

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.960
to feel the intensity

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.680
otherwise you’re with me

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.360
nice and light.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.800
Keep those arms nice and loose again,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.200
building that heart rate up,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.800
just that little bit more

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
looking good guys, 10 seconds

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.320
and bring it down nice and steady.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.200
Okay, very, very, very quick stretch.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.480
Starting off, feet slightly apart.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.720
I just want you to take the arm

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.240
up and over,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.400
start to stretch through the upper body.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.960
Now, this is only a warm up,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.960
so you only going to hold this

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.080
for a few seconds.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.640
Changing sides.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.600
Lengthening through the upper body,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.840
through the core

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.960
and bring it down from there.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.720
We're just going to quickly

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120
take it in to the quads.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.800
Few seconds.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.360
If you need to hold onto something,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.080
you can

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.640
and switch sides.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.200
Again,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.920
a few more seconds,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.800
go to right.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.800
Very, very last one.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.480
We're going to be up on our feet today.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.680
So I just want you to take it

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.360
through the calf.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.080
So back foot flat

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.920
pointing forward

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.120
you just going to push

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.320
into the front leg,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.000
feel that stretch for a few more seconds

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.120
and switch sides

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.640
and relax there.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.480
Right, shake it out.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.600
We're ready to go in the main session.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.320
Okay, guys,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.680
so into the main session now

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.600
we're going to go in 20 seconds, okay.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.160
I'm going to start

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.680
by demonstrating the first move.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.040
So that's going to be a jumping Jack.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.960
So from here, feet coming out.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.240
Hands coming above your head.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.960
That's the jumping Jack, there.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.840
If you don’t want to jump with us today,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.440
I just want you to take it to a side step, alright.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.280
Still using those arms.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.960
We're going in five,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.200
four, three, two, one.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.840
Here we go. Jumping Jack.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.240
So feet wide, soft in the knees,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.360
hands above the head.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.320
That's option one there,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.480
option two, If you need it,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.880
I'm going to take it down,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.600
still putting the same energy

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.160
through the arms,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.360
but feet

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.400
are going side to side

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.880
and we're taking out all that impact.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.200
You got ten more seconds here.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.600
Then we're going to go into a 30 seconds rest.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.160
Keep it there.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.760
Three, two, one..

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.000
easy, 30 seconds rest.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.840
Try and keep moving,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.880
shake it off.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.800
Your next move, we're calling it a box step.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.360
So all you going to do,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.920
stepping forward with the feet.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.200
Forward, forward, followed by back, back.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.200
You're going to take it nice and steady like that.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.680
Alright, still resting.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.800
You got ten more seconds of rest.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.640
Just try and keep moving.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.880
Big deep breath.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.520
We're going into box step in

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.840
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.360
Here we go. Forward, forward, back, back.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.240
So again we are soft through the knees,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.120
nice and steady.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.400
Now you can take this as fast

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.480
or as slow as you want to, alright.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.120
I wanted sort of a nice, steady pace there,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.040
if you want a bit more, you can speed it up

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.480
or you can slow it right down. Right.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.880
This is your workout today.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.720
So you take it to

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.240
whatever level you want to.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.720
Five more seconds.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.680
Five, four, three,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.040
two, one.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.560
30 seconds rest.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.560
Well done.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.760
Shake it off, guys.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.760
Just try and keep moving and breathe.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.520
Third exercise is going to be a squat

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.520
after this 30 seconds rest, right?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.960
So when we're squatting feet apart,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.200
you're going to bend through the knees

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.520
into that squat position.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.960
Now, 10 seconds.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.920
I want you to think about

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.360
sitting back in the hips

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.280
and keeping your chest up as you do this.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.080
Alright. Lifting that head.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.680
Here we go.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.680
In three, two, one.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.400
Let's go.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.800
So the weight

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.520
should be back in the heels.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.480
And you want to feel like

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.400
you're about to sit down on a chair

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.760
driving up through the heels

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.840
as you come up

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.680
and keeping that head

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.920
and chest lifted at all times.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.280
Now, options for this.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.600
As you can see,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.560
I'm taking my hips to about knee level there.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.400
Alright.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.440
If you don’t want to go that far down today,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.760
you can just take it into a little half squat.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.600
Alright.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.040
Entirely up to you.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.040
Three, two, one.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.800
And rest there. Well done.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.760
Shake it out.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.200
Okay, guys, your next move,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.360
very similar to the warm up

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360
that we did earlier.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.880
You’re going to go into

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.360
to a high knee march, right

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.000
so driving the knees up

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.640
while we're on the spot like this,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.400
bringing in the arms as well.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.880
You've got that in 10 seconds.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.000
Big deep breath.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.520
Ready to go in.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.080
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.120
Let's go.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.080
So with this, I really want you to concentrate

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.920
on keeping the upper body up

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.840
and you using the core to drive the knee

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.160
nice and high,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.360
bringing in those arms as well

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.720
to bring the upper body.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.760
Good. Now, again,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.840
doesn't have to come all the way up.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.800
If you don't want it to,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.920
you can keep it nice and steady

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.960
and just that little bit lower.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.120
Otherwise we're driving

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.080
and that's going to drive

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.520
that heart rate as well.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.560
Three, two, one.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.320
Rest there, shake it off.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.440
Guys, you got one more exercise, one more.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.600
Take the lateral movement side to side.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.920
So, feet are going to be apart.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.360
And all you're going to do is you're going to step to the side

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.280
ever so slightly and then just tap that other foot.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.320
So you open down like that, right?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.280
Little bit of an aerobic movement.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.120
We're going in five, four,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.120
three, two, one.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.680
Let's go.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.280
So side to side, we call this a side touch.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.640
Side touch, side touch.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.040
Nice and easy, light on the feet.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.920
Lifted through the chest.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.840
Now again, we can progress and regress this as we need to.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.920
So if you want a little bit more,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.320
try and bend the knees

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.640
that little bit more.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.600
It brings in a bit more of a squat element.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.960
Otherwise just stay nice and lifted

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.640
nice and light.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.600
You got a few more seconds here.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.240
Three, two, one.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.840
And relax, guys.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.400
That's it. Five exercises done.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.080
That's your taster session.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.960
We're going to bring it down for a cool down.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.640
Okay, guys.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.000
So just cooling down

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.800
nice and steady here, right?

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.320
We're just going to start

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.680
with a very, very, very light march.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.400
So your heart rate

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.360
will be a little bit elevated.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.160
We don't want to completely stop straight away.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
We want it to come down that little bit.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.680
Okay. So we're just nice light march on the spot.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.960
That's it. Not like the way we warmed up.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.680
Or, the way we exercised there.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.040
Just very, very nice lifts, small lifts,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.520
nice and light on the feet.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.040
Okay, guys, in a few seconds,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.600
you're going to stretch out the quads.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.920
Okay, so

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.720
stopping there again, grab onto something

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.680
if you need to.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.280
Foot back,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.120
I want you to bring those knees together

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.080
if you can.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.640
And the more you push those hips forward,

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.560
the more you'll feel that stretch

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.840
down the quads.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.920
Good.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.360
Okay, release there and change legs.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.280
So exactly the same again,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.720
find that balance, knees together

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.360
hips forward,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.680
stretching through the quads.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.000
Nice guys.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.360
and kick out of it there. Well done.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.040
So moving down the body into the hamstring

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.160
So for your hamstring stretch,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.920
what I want you to do

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.720
is take one foot out

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.360
slightly further forward than the other.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.320
You just going to sit back in those hips,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.720
rest your hands on your supporting leg there.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.480
And on this you straightened leg here

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.600
you just feel that stretch

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.720
right up the back of your legs.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.800
Hold it there for a few more seconds

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.920
and release, change legs.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.200
So same again.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.760
If you look at me from the side,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.400
my hips are back

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.400
I’m relaxing under that supporting leg.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.000
My other leg nice and straight

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.080
really feeling the stretch.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.080
few more seconds there and release.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.480
Alright, final one, guys.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.240
We're just going to take it back into those calfs.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.200
You did a few impact moves there,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.600
so you want to take your back foot

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.120
flat to the floor, point it forward

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.280
and then push the weight

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.560
into that front leg there.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.640
That's it. Just until you feel the stretch,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.920
don't go too far,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.880
but you still want to feel it working

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.920
right through the lower body.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.480
You've got a few more seconds here,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.200
then we're going to change sides.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.280
Good and release there, change legs.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.920
So same again.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.640
Flat to the floor point it forward

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.640
and then just sink into that stretch.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.000
Good.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.440
Nearly there guys.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.880
And release,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.640
shake it off.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.640
Brilliant guys.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.240
Well done guys you've just completed

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.400
the taster cardio base session.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.080
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.000
Why not go and try the beginner cardio session

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.280
or you can even do the stretch and strive session.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.440
You can find them all on your dashboard.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.920
Please leave us some feedback

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.520
and remember it's always better to

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.480
strive together.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.120
Thank you.
